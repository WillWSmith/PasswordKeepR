## Intro



### Demo

Thank you for the introduction Marie. Let's start with the first thing you see upon reaching our website. Here you can see the login page, this is standard procedure and upon logging in we will be adding a yummy little cookie with some details about the user we will be using on the next page. However if you were a returning user who left the page logged in. We will catch that yummy cookie and send you right on into the index page without you having to see this login page.

Upon logging in or returning to our website you will be greeted with the index page. Here you can see all of your organizations accounts and have the option to filter the results shown based on the category you choose. Once you locate the account information you are looking for, you can use our handy copy buttons to quickly capture those values. With the visual checkmark indicator you can swap tabs and paste with confidence that the information you need has been copied to your clipboard!

Now, perhaps you are a person of style. You like to have options. Well we get that and have included a nice little background selector feature in the footer of our website to ensure you get the style that works for you. Dont worry, we will remember your selection for you, so you can continue on with your busy workday.

Now that we have a fresh new look lets get back to the task at hand! Your organization appears to have started to use a new account and you need to share that with the rest of your organization. No problem! You can conveniently click on the "Add New Account" button and add that new account information for us to remember for you! Are you not sure if your password is strong enough? Dont worry our password strength indentifier will let you know! Now you may have also noticed that Generate Password text, dont worry we will get to that in a moment!

Alright! We have added our new account and we can see it in our index. However we have noticed that we made a typo and need to edit the password.
Thats okay! Simply click the "Edit" button and update the password to the correct password. However your last password was also fairly weak. Lets try using the Password Generator to generate a new strong password to keep your account safe! Here you have the option to choose the length of your password provided it is more than 8 characters and less than 32. You also have the option to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. Remember the more options selected the stronger your password will be! Once generated use the handy copy feature to quickly add it as your accounts new password.

With that done you seem to only have two tasks left in your workday. First you need to delete some older accounts your organization no longer uses. You can easily do that with our delete button! With that done you can now authorize your new assistant to have access to your organizations account information. Simply click on "Create a New User" to add a new authorized user to the organization. This will allow the user to sign in to our website and access your organizations account info.

Finally after doing everything you need with PasswordKeepR for the day you decide to keep your account safe and click the "Logout" button. This will delete that yummy cookie and send you back to the login page.


Thank you for choosing PasswordKeepR.
